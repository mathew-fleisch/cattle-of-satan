This is not Settlers of Catan.

## Order of Operations
A host starts a game, which returns a code for other players to join, and can start once 3 OR 4 players join. If a player joins after the 4 available slots are taken, an anonymous view is displayed. If a player tries to join after a game has completed, a replay is displayed.
